# asrom-iiwa-stack

This repository uses the ROS-based control implemented in IFL-CAMP/iiwa_stack and extends it to work with the experimental setup at the Autonomous Space Robotics and Mechatronics (ASRoM) Laboratory at Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada. The purpose of this repository is to enable new research using the pair of KUKA LBR iiwa 7kg arms at the laboratory.
